- Bounty program: 50000 ETR
- Airdrop program: 9.99 tokens * 10000 users = 99900 ETR

### Sales program:
```
10000 ETR = 1 ETH (constant);      
```
Purchase more than 1 ETH counts by geometric progression, until total supply reaches 10 billions.
```
1 ETH = 10,000 ^ 1 = 10,000,         
2 ETH = 20,000 ^ 2 = 40,000,         
3 ETH = 30,000 ^ 3 = 90,000,           
..
```

Closed when total supply reaches 10 billions    
###### **! after reaches this value new tokens cant be sold via contract**

### POI program:

Percents profit table in **percents by day** (%/day)

periods      | day           | week         | month         | year
------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------  
1st year     | 0,600%        | 0,750%       | 0,850%        | 1,000%
